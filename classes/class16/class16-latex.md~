  your proposal by email to <a
  href="mailto:evans@virginia.edu"><em>evans@virginia.edu</em></a> with

`cc:` all the team members in the email so I have one email to reply-all
to that will reach your full tem.

3. Motivation - explanation of why your project topic is worthwhile.

4. Project Plan - what you plan to do.

5. First deliverable - description of what you will have ready to submit
