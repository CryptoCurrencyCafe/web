viewer.  <br>If you [download the slides](|filename|./class12-inked.pptx), they are present though.
Hopefully, the player will be fixed someday. </div>

## Difficulty

[Bitcoin Difficulty increased yesterday!](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty): 46684376316

This invalidates our results from the previous class about the SP20

per month). 

PointCoin's difficulty rate reveals something about when students got
their miners working, and about how EC2 throttles micro instances:
