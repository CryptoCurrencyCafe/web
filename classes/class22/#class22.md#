Title: Class 22: Subsidies, Ombuds, Melange
Date: 2015-04-06

## Schedule

If your group didn't already send me a project progress update, please
remember to do so by midnight tonight.  Your update should either point
to your first deliverable (as specified in your proposal), or explain
what progress you've made and issues that have come up.  It does not
need to be a long or formal report, but enough to see that you're making
progress and raise any issues before it is too late to deal with them. 

Thursday evening at 6pm in Comm School (RRH) room 223 there will be a
bitcoin panel hosted by Carol Van Cleef, and including Alex Kuck, Nick
Skelsey, Josh Cincinnati, David Evans, and Denis Nekipelov as panelists.
Please fill in this form to make sure they order enough pizza:
