# Bloom Filters

Burton Bloom, [_Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable
Errors_](|filename|./bloom.pdf), Communications of the ACM, July 1970.

### Conventional Hash Table

Store collection of $N$ $b$-bit elements, using $k > N$ cells.

$H$ is pseudorandom function, $H(x) \leftarrow [0, k)$.

### Bloom Filter

Tradeoff: shrink size of array to store, accept false matches.  

$m$ = number of bits in array  
$k$ = number of hash functions  
$n$ = number of elements

What is the probability a given element of the array is not selected by a particular hash function?

</div>

What is the probability a given element of the array is not selected for
a particular element by any of the $k$ hash functions?
<div class="gap">
#
#
</div>

After $n$ elements, what is the probability that an array bit is 0?

</div>

Probability of false match:

$$
(1 - (1 - 1/m)^{kn})^k
$$

How big should $m$ be to have less than 0.01\% false positive rate for a block with 1000 addresses?
