# Bloom Filters

Burton Bloom, [_Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable
Errors_](|filename|./bloom.pdf), Communications of the ACM, July 1970.

### Conventional Hash Table

Store collection of _N_ _b_-bit elements, using _k_ &gt; _N_ cells.

_H_ is pseudorandom function, _H_(_x_) &larr; [0, _k_).

<div class="gap">

</div>

### Bloom Filter

Tradeoff: shrink size of array to store, accept false matches.  

_m_ = number of bits in array  
_k_ = number of hash functions  
_n_ = number of elements

What is the probability a given element of the array is not selected by a particular hash function?
<div class="gap">

</div>

What is the probability a given element of the array is not selected for
a particular element by any of the _k_ hash functions?
<div class="gap">

</div>

After _n_ elements, what is the probability that an array bit is 0?
<div class="gap">

</div>

Probability of false match: (1 - (1 - 1/_m_)<sup>_kn_</sup>)<sup>_k_</sup>


How big should _m_ be to have less than 0.01% false positive rate for a block with 1000 addresses?
