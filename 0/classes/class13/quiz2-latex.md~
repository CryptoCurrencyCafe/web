**Your Name:** ____________________________

For this quiz, you should **work alone**.  You may use your course notes,
but no other resources.  Answer all the questions as well as you can.
Good answers will be clear, consise, and correct.

### Notations

**Key pair:** $KU_x$ is the p**U**blic key, $KR_x$ is the p**R**ivate key  
**Alice's keys:** $KU_A$ (Alice's public key), $KR_A$ (Alice's private key)  
**Bob's keys:** $KU_B$ (Bob's public key), $KR_B$ (Bob's private key)  

**Encryption:** $E_K(m)$ is the encryption of message $m$ using key $K$.
(This notation is used for both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, the
key determines the intended encryption.)

**Hashing:** $H$ is a cryptographic hash function.

**Concatenation:** $A || B$ is the concatenation of the two bitstrings.

**1.** Colleen Cryptofferson is designing a new cryptocurrency based on
  a consensus-based public ledger, and considering several possible ways
  to report a transaction where Alice sends coin $X$ to Bob.  (You may
  assume $X$ is a string that is used to validly identify Alice as the
  owner of the coin.)

For each scheme, indicate if it is reasonable, or write a short
explanation why it is terrible.

a. $E_{KU_A}(X \text{ to }KU_B)$

**2.** Darcy Discerning suggests that Colleen Cryptofferson should use
$$E_{KR_A}(H(X \text{ to } KU_B)) || X \text{ to } KU_B$$ instead.  Is this a good
idea?  (If not, explain what it is not a good way to report a
transaction; if so, explain what it is better than any of the options in
question 1.)

**3.** To implement her cryptosystem, Colleen Cryptofferson needs a
  blockchain design.  Emily Elephant suggests making the block header:

|-|-|-|-|
|**Label**|**Bytes**|**Description**|
|`block_number`|4|Number of this block|
|`merkle_root`|32|Hash of Merkle tree of all transactions|
|`nonce`|4|Nonce found to generate this block|

A block is (`block header` || `transactions`).  A block is valid if all
of the following are true (but no other validity checks are required):

a. $H(block header)$ (interpreted using the Base58 encoding as used in bitcoin addresses) starts with 'Emily'.
b. The `block_number` in the block is the previous block's `block_number` + 1 (and the genesis block uses `block_number` = 0).
c. The `merkle_root` in the block header is the hash of the root of a Merkle tree constructed from the `transactions`.

Give at least two major problems with Emily's design:
