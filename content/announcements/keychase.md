Title: Key Chase
Date: 2014-01-22

As mentioned in class today, each of you should have received a small
deposit in your wallet.  You will need this for Project 1, but should
also use it as a starting point for attempting to learn as much as you
can about how we transfered funds (and possibly solve the puzzle leading
to something interesting).  You can try tracing the transaction both
forward and backward, trying to learn things like: where did the initial
coin come from and when did I buy it, how long did it take for all the
coin to be distributed, how much did it cost in transaction fees, etc.

Note that each of you had a different bitcoin address, so you all have
different starting points for examining the transactions.

Post interesting things you learn in the comments below.
