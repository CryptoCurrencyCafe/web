## Schedule 

   <div class="todo">

- If you didnâ€™t get full credit for Project 1 because of failure to post
  something interesting, you can (and should!) redeem yourself and earn
  full credit by **posting an interesting comment by Thursday**.  It can
  be on (1) Discussion questions from Project 1 (2) notes from classes,
  or (3) general forum.

- **Read:** [_Chapter 6: The Bitcoin
Network_](https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch06.asciidoc),
[_Chapter 7: The
Blockchain_](https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch07.asciidoc)
from Andreas Antonopoulos' book.  (Ideally, you should finish these
before Wednesday's class, but at the latest by Monday, 9 Feb.)

# Proof-of-Work

Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor.  [_Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail_](|filename|./pvp.pdf), CRYPTO 1992.

**Pricing Function**: ($f$)
- moderately easy to compute
- cannot be amortized 
- computing $f(m_1),..., f(m_l)$ costs $l$ times as much as computing $f(m_i)$. 
- easily verified: given $x$, $y$ easy to check $y = f(x)$.

Adam Back. [_Hash Cash Postage Implementation_](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/announce.txt)

**Interactive Hashcash**:  
1. Sender to Receiver: `Hello`  
2. Receiver to Sender: $r$ (random nonce)  
3. Sender to Receiver: $x$, `Mail` where $x = f(r)$  
4. Receiver verifies $x = f(r)$.  

How well does this protocol work for sending mail?

Suppose we use SHA-256 for $f$?

How can we make this protocol non-interactive?

# Bitcoin Mining

Proof-of-work: Find an $x$ such that: SHA-256(SHA-256($r$ + $x$)) < $T/d$.

$d$ is the "difficulty" (varies).  
$T$ is a fixed target (256-bit number).  
$r$ depends on hash of previous block, transactions, and other information.

What does it mean for the bitcoin difficulty to go down?

[BitcoinMiner](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/miner.cpp) (code from core Bitcoin implementation)

```c
//
// ScanHash scans nonces looking for a hash with at least some zero bits.
// The nonce is usually preserved between calls, but periodically or if the
// nonce is 0xffff0000 or above, the block is rebuilt and nNonce starts over at
// zero.
//
bool static ScanHash(const CBlockHeader *pblock, uint32_t& nNonce, uint256 *phash)
{
    // Write the first 76 bytes of the block header to a double-SHA256 state.
    CHash256 hasher;
    CDataStream ss(SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION);
    ss << *pblock;
    assert(ss.size() == 80);
    hasher.Write((unsigned char*)&ss[0], 76);

    while (true) {
        nNonce++;

        // Write the last 4 bytes of the block header (the nonce) to a copy of
        // the double-SHA256 state, and compute the result.
        CHash256(hasher).Write((unsigned char*)&nNonce, 4).Finalize((unsigned char*)phash);

        // Return the nonce if the hash has at least some zero bits,
        // caller will check if it has enough to reach the target
        if (((uint16_t*)phash)[15] == 0)
            return true;

        // If nothing found after trying for a while, return -1
        if ((nNonce & 0xfff) == 0)
            return false;
