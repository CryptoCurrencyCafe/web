Title: Project 1 - Too Vain?
Date: 2015-01-19

   <div class="discuss"> <b>Discussion Question.</b> Is your vanity
   address more or less secure than the first address you generated?
   What about a service like
   [http://bitcoinvanitygen.com/](http://bitcoinvanitygen.com/)?  Would
   some who uses such a service to generate their bitcoin address be
   [too vain for their own
   good](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/21foj9/funds_currently_being_stolen_from_vanity/)?
