Title: Project 1 - Double Spending
Date: 2015-01-19

   <div class="discuss"> <b>Exercise and Discussion.</b> Try to double
spend the same bitcoin by sending it twice to your wallet address.
Figure out as much as you can about what happens when the double spend
transactions are attempted.  See how close you can get to obtaining two
verified transactions spending the same coin (e.g., can you achieve two
transactions with at least one confirmation each?)

Please don't try to actually rip anyone off; only attempt double
spending with your own addresses (or those of willing classmates).  

Post about your experiences on below.  Include links to transactions in
the blockchain to demonstrate your results.
