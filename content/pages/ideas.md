**Better Bitcoin FAQ.** The official bitcoin FAQ,
  [https://bitcoin.org/en/faq](https://bitcoin.org/en/faq), reads more
  like an advocacy document than an honest FAQ.  Critique the answers
  given there, and write better answers for questions that need them,
  trying to provide a more balanced and sound perspective.

**Money for Developing World.** In their [2015 Annual
  Letter](http://www.gatesnotes.com/2015-annual-letter?page=3&lang=en),
  Bill and Melinda Gates call out the development of mobile banking as
  one of the four key areas where breakthroughs over the next 15 years
  will dramatically improve the lives of the poor.  Can cryptocurrencies
  be part of the solution to financial challenges in low-income areas?
  Compare existing approaches to mobile money such as
  [M-Pesa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa) (which charges
  transaction fees of 0.16% to 0.66%) to what could be done with
  cryptocurrency.  Is bitcoin a suitable cryptocurrency for this
  purpose?  If not, what would work better?  

**Weak Keys.** Examine transactions in the blockchain for weak keys or
  mistakes in target addresses.  Joppe W. Bos, J. Alex Halderman, Nadia
  Heninger, Jonathan Moore, Michael Naehrig, and Eric Wustrow.

**Predicting Bitcoin market price.** What factors impact the price of
Bitcoin?  Devavrat Shah and Kang Zhang, [_Bayesian Regression and
Bitcoin_](http://arxiv-web3.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1410.1231v1.pdf)
shows that this can be done over very short term.  What about over
longer time periods?
