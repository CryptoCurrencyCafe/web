# Bitcoin Wallets

- [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) &mdash; full client
  ([source](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/src), mostly
  C++).  This is a full client, which means it maintains a complete copy
  of the blockchain (currently about 20 GB) on the client machine, and
  won't be ready to use until the full blockchain is downloaded.

- [MultiBit](https://multibit.org/) &mdash; lightweight client
  ([source](https://github.com/jim618/multibit), mostly Java)
