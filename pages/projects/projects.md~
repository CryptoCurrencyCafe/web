This project takes a look into Bitcoin exchanges (Coinbase and Circle)
to formulate a methodology by which we can understand how various
exchanges operate to better invest in Bitcoin.

In our project we explore strategies such as transaction visualization,
taint analysis, fulfillment processes, and pricing models to create an
evaluation methodology.

## Analysis of Locking Scripts in the Blockchain
Saba Eskandarian

**Description:** This project aimed to learn about what kinds of unusual
  scripts are being used in bitcoin transactions and how this has
  changed over time by creating a script that analyzes the blockchain
  and keeps track of unusual transactions which are then explorable via
  a web page and reports of script usage generated by the script.

## Bitcoin Price History
Oriana Ngo

_An analysis on the events affecting bitcoin market price_

**Description:** Earlier in bitcoin, international events and news
stories had a very immediate and significant effect on the bitcoin
market price, resulting in high volatility; my project examines this
effect to analyze which factors affected bitcoin and the explanation
behind it.

In-depth look at one of the past
"native" (occurred strictly within bitcoin) and historical events that
effected bitcoin price history and was not covered in the timeline.
Because another bitcoin halving will occur soon and once again affect
the market price, I felt it important and supplementary to include.
This part also serves as a prediction for the next halving.
