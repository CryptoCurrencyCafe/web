Title: Project Ideas
Date: 2015-02-14

Below are some ideas for course projects.  This is just a list meant to
get you thinking about potential projects, not meant to limit or confine
what you end up selecting for your project topic.


**Blockchain Analysis.** The blockchain contains information about every
  transaction that has ever been done with bitcoin.  There are lots of
  interesting things that can be learned by analyzing the blockchain,
  such as investigating how people (including criminals) are using
  bitcoin, looking at how mining has changed over time, investigating
  transactions involving interesting bitcoin addresses, etc.

**Better Bitcoin FAQ.** The official bitcoin FAQ,
  [https://bitcoin.org/en/faq](https://bitcoin.org/en/faq), reads more
  like an advocacy document than an honest FAQ.  Critique the answers
  given there, and write better answers for questions that need them,
  trying to provide a more balanced and sound perspective.

**Money for Developing World.** In their [2015 Annual
  Letter](http://www.gatesnotes.com/2015-annual-letter?page=3&lang=en),
  Bill and Melinda Gates call out the development of mobile banking as
  one of the four key areas where breakthroughs over the next 15 years
  will dramatically improve the lives of the poor.  Can cryptocurrencies
  be part of the solution to financial challenges in low-income areas?
  Compare existing approaches to mobile money such as
  [M-Pesa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa) (which charges
  transaction fees of 0.16% to 0.66%) to what could be done with
  cryptocurrency.  Is bitcoin a suitable cryptocurrency for this
  purpose?  If not, what would work better?  

**Weak Keys.** Examine transactions in the blockchain for weak keys or
  mistakes in target addresses.  Joppe W. Bos, J. Alex Halderman, Nadia
  Heninger, Jonathan Moore, Michael Naehrig, and Eric Wustrow.
  [_Elliptic Curve Cryptography in
  Practice_](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/734.pdf), Financial Crypto
  2014.

**Predicting Bitcoin market price.** What factors impact the price of
Bitcoin?  Devavrat Shah and Kang Zhang, [_Bayesian Regression and
Bitcoin_](http://arxiv-web3.library.cornell.edu/pdf/1410.1231v1.pdf)
shows that this can be done over very short term.  What about over
longer time periods?

**Novel uses of the Blockchain.** Figure out other interesting things to
  do with the blockchain.  Some examples: [name
  registration](http://namecoin.info/),
  [messaging](https://github.com/barisser/bitcrypt) and
  [bitmessage](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page), [contracts](https://codius.org/), 
  [key-value store](http://blog.onename.com/blockstore-bitcoin/), etc.

**Develop your own cryptocurrency.** There are many possible ways to
  implement a cryptocurrency, with different advantages and trade-offs.
  Explore an interesting point in the design space.

**Update Bitcoin Wiki Pages.** Many of the [Bitcoin
  Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page) pages are badly outdated
  (although it remains one of the most reliable sources for bitcoin
  information).  As an example, when I prepared the class on mining
  pools (Feb 17), the largest mining pool was
  [AntPool](https://www.antpool.com/).  But, the [Pooled
  Mining](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pooled_mining) page does not
  include it in the class of "Major" pools (9 top pools), and [its own
  page](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/AntPool) has very little information.
  Pick a topic of importance and interest, and update and significantly
  improve the Bitcoin wiki pages on that topic.

**Predicting Block 420,000.** Predict what impact the halving of the
  subsidy at block 420,000 is likely to have.  Analyze what happened
  when the previous subsidy halving happened, and how things have
  changed since then, to come up with a better idea what should happen
  at the next halving than we did in [Class
  11](|filename|../classes/class11/class11.md).

**Committment-based Mining Pools.** Are there better ways for mining
  pools to ensure members behave properly and get a fair share of
  proceeds than the current proof-of-work based approaches?  That are
  the costs and benefits of alternate schemes.
